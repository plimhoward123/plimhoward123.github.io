As many 13 year old's were at the time, my obsession was playing on the original Xbox. Spending plenty of days and many nights on my console, it began to exhibit some hardware issues. Being a curious teenager I looked into taking apart my console and cleaning it. After many forum posts and some frustrating twists and turns, I was able to open the console. What laid before my eyes was a mix of fear and incredible interest. 

The fear of breaking my favorite console was quickly ushered out by a fascination on how this all worked together. After all, it brought me many hours of entertainment. 
Around this time a Xbox modding scene was being born within the many forums I had been using. This is where I found my self a new hobby to learn: the symbiotic relationship of software, and hardware.

I began to learn various languages including, Assembly, C, C#, Visual Basic and Java. Reading examples and playing with code was the best way to learn these various languages for me. After many trails and errors I became very familiar with these languages. 

Eventually my interests shifted and I took a long break from coding. I hadn't seen my hobby as a potential career path for many years, as college wasn't a focus at the time. After years of contemplating what I wanted to do with my life, I decided to take my previous knowledge of coding and structure it with this program at Flatiron.
