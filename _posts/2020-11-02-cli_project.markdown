This project has summed up a lot of the backend work that goes into an application. Managing class objects into information that can be parsed is an essential back end process that goes into may forms and applications.

For my project, I found a website that list's many of the available bootcamps and their descriptions and reviews. 
It was a website that helped me find myself here to FlatIron.


Parsing through the HTML to gather information, I had the application create a new class objects, store all of the information, and pull from that information based on user input. Being this far into the program, i see this is the fundemental back end of what a UI based app is comprised of. The console input being the basic UI of the application.
